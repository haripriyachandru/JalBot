            "Generating a truly detailed, real-time report on West Bengal's current water situation requires access to live monitoring data and government resources. However, I can offer a general overview based on publicly available information:\n\n**Surface Water:** West Bengal is traversed by major rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and their tributaries.  These are vital for irrigation, domestic use, and industry. However, pollution and seasonal variations in flow remain challenges.  During monsoon season, flooding can be a concern, while dry seasons can lead to water scarcity in certain areas.\n\n**Groundwater:**  West Bengal relies significantly on groundwater for various needs.  The state has diverse hydrogeological conditions.  Alluvial aquifers in the Gangetic plains are generally productive, while hard rock aquifers in other regions have lower yields.  Over-extraction of groundwater, especially in urban areas and for agriculture, is a growing concern, leading to declining water levels in some areas.  Arsenic contamination in groundwater is also a significant issue in certain districts.\n\n**Water Quality:**  Water quality is a pressing issue.  Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage contribute to pollution in both surface and groundwater sources.  This poses risks to human health and ecosystem well-being.\n\n**Management Efforts:** The state government has implemented various water management initiatives, including promoting rainwater harvesting, constructing check dams, and implementing water conservation awareness programs.  Addressing pollution and ensuring equitable water distribution remain key challenges.\n\nFor detailed and up-to-date information, it's essential to consult the West Bengal State Water Resources Investigation & Development and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. They hold the most current data and reports.\n\n\n"

The primary objective of establishing \nthe ground water monitoring network stations is to record the response of ground water regime to \nthe natural and anthropogenic stresses of recharge and discharge parameters with reference to \ngeology, climate, physiography, land use pattern and hydrologic characteristics.  \nGround water levels are being monitored throughout the Country four times in a year by Central \nGround Water Board through a network of 23196 monitoring wells during the months of January, \nPremonsoon (March/April/ May), August and Postmonsoon.  \nThe ground water regime monitoring was started in the year 1969 by Central Ground Water Board. \nAt present CGWB has a network of 22339 ground water observation wells, out of which 16190 \nobservation wells are dugwells and 6149 are piezometers. The water level / piezometric head data \ncollected from these observations were entered into the National database and are analysed for \nobtaining background information of ground water regime and changes on regional scale. The \nGroundwater level data has been collected from all the states except for Mizoram & Sikkim and UT \nof Lakshadweep where water level monitoring is not being carried out.  \n \nWater level data of Premonsoon 2018 has been analysed to illustrate spatial distribution of water \nlevel and its categorization under different ranges. The Premonsoon data has been compared with \nthe previous year Premonsoon data (annual fluctuation) and mean of last 10 years Premonsoon \nmonitoring data (decadal fluctuation); the analytical results are represented through tables and \nmaps along with suitable explanations. Database thus generated forms the basis for planning the \nground water development and management programme. This data is also used for assessment of \nground water resources and establishing changes in the regime consequent to various \ndevelopment and management activities.  \n  \n3 \n \n \n  \n4 \n  \n \nPlate II \n \nSource: National Data Centre, CGWB, Faridabad  \n5 \n \n3.0  Ground Water Level Scenario in India   \n3.1 Ground Water Level Scenario - Premonsoon 2018 \nThe ground water level data for Premonsoon 2018 indicates that out of the total 14591 wells \nanalysed, 872 (6 %) wells are showing water level less than 2 m bgl (metres below ground level), \n3746 (26%) wells are showing water level in the depth range of 2-5 m bgl, 5886 (41 %) wells are \nshowing water level in the depth range of 5-10 m bgl, 3115 (21%) wells are showing water level in \nthe depth range of 10-20 m bgl, 712 (5%) wells are showing water level in the depth range of 20-40 \nm bgl and the remaining 260 (2%) wells are showing water level more than 40 m bgl. The maximum \ndepth to water level of 114.00 m bgl is observed in Bikaner district of Rajasthan whereas the \nminimum is less than 1 m bgl.  \nPerusal of the water level data of Premonsoon 2018 for the country reveals that the general depth to \nwater level of the country ranges from 5 to 20 m bgl.   To be more specific, in major parts of the \ncountry, water level is observed to be in the range of 5 to 10 m. Very shallow water level of less \nthan 2 m bgl is also observed locally, in isolated pockets, in few states, such as  Assam, Andhra \nPradesh, Maharashtra, and Odisha. Major part of the state of Assam shows water level in the range \nof 2-5 m bgl. In the eastern coastal region of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, water level og 2-5 m bgl \ncan be observed. In major parts of north-western and western states, depth to water level is generally \ndeeper and ranges from about 10- 40 m bgl. In parts Delhi and Rajasthan, water level of more than \n40 m bgl is also recorded. Also, small pockets in Tamil Nadu shows water level of more than 40 m \nbgl. The peninsular part of country recorded a water level in the range of 5 to 20 m bgl.   \n \n \nFig 1 \n \n  \n6 \n \nPlate III \n       Source: National Data Centre, CGWB, Faridabad  \n7 \n \n3.2 Water Level Fluctuation (Premonsoon 2018 to Premonsoon 2017)   \nThe water level fluctuation of Premonsoon 2018 compared to to Premonsoon 2017 shows \nthat out of 13255 wells analysed, 6941 (52%) are showing rise and 5721 (43%) are showing fall in \nwater level.

The primary objective of establishing \nthe ground water monitoring network stations is to record the response of ground water regime to \nthe natural and anthropogenic stresses of recharge and discharge parameters with reference to \ngeology, climate, physiography, land use pattern and hydrologic characteristics.  \nGround water levels are being monitored throughout the Country four times in a year by Central \nGround Water Board through a network of 23196 monitoring wells during the months of January, \nPremonsoon (March/April/ May), August and Postmonsoon.  \nThe ground water regime monitoring was started in the year 1969 by Central Ground Water Board. \nAt present CGWB has a network of 22339 ground water observation wells, out of which 16190 \nobservation wells are dugwells and 6149 are piezometers. The water level / piezometric head data \ncollected from these observations were entered into the National database and are analysed for \nobtaining background information of ground water regime and changes on regional scale. The \nGroundwater level data has been collected from all the states except for Mizoram & Sikkim and UT \nof Lakshadweep where water level monitoring is not being carried out.  \n \nWater level data of Premonsoon 2018 has been analysed to illustrate spatial distribution of water \nlevel and its categorization under different ranges. The Premonsoon data has been compared with \nthe previous year Premonsoon data (annual fluctuation) and mean of last 10 years Premonsoon \nmonitoring data (decadal fluctuation); the analytical results are represented through tables and \nmaps along with suitable explanations. Database thus generated forms the basis for planning the \nground water development and management programme. This data is also used for assessment of \nground water resources and establishing changes in the regime consequent to various \ndevelopment and management activities.  \n  \n3 \n \n \n  \n4 \n  \n \nPlate II \n \nSource: National Data Centre, CGWB, Faridabad  \n5 \n \n3.0  Ground Water Level Scenario in India   \n3.1 Ground Water Level Scenario - Premonsoon 2018 \nThe ground water level data for Premonsoon 2018 indicates that out of the total 14591 wells \nanalysed, 872 (6 %) wells are showing water level less than 2 m bgl (metres below ground level), \n3746 (26%) wells are showing water level in the depth range of 2-5 m bgl, 5886 (41 %) wells are \nshowing water level in the depth range of 5-10 m bgl, 3115 (21%) wells are showing water level in \nthe depth range of 10-20 m bgl, 712 (5%) wells are showing water level in the depth range of 20-40 \nm bgl and the remaining 260 (2%) wells are showing water level more than 40 m bgl.
